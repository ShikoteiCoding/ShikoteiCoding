# Welcome to my Git Profile

You can see there only my personnal repositories.

## My ongoing projects
- Trading Bot and Finance Exploration: Personnal framework to backtest and deploy bots while using data engineer knowledge to orchestrate bots (maybe even share information such as wallet etc...).
    - Python: Pandas, Numpy - Processing / Manipulation
    - APIs: Yahoo Finance / Polygon - Enriched Data (Financial etc ...)
    - Broker: Any, abstraction layer - Market data + Orders
    - Database: PostgreSQL - Store orders / trades and positions

    - Database: Postgresql - Store my positions
    - Real Time Processing: Kafka / PySpark - Real time processing event-driven
    - Visualization: Javascript + D3.js
    - Orchestration: Kubernetes (Minikube locally)
- Anything else: Practicing software development / infrastructure and algorithmic over different projects.
